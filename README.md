## 💻 Technology

The app is built using React.js for the front-end, JavaScript for the logic, SCSS for styling, Node.js for the back-end and Firebase for data storage and retrieval. The app also utilizes a RESTful API to connect to the Firebase database.


## 🐾 Take your first step

🔹 Clone the project or download the files by going to the repository up above.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/TanyaGr9191/disneyPlus-clone.git
```
🔹 Go to the backend folder:
```sh
cd backend
```
>**Note:** Ensure that node_modules are installed first.

🔹 Next, we'll start the server with 'npm start':
```sh
npm i
npm start
```
>**Note:** You should receive a terminal output verifying the server's status at port 3030.

🔹 Now carry out the same steps for the frontend folder.
```sh
cd frontend
npm i
npm start
```

>**Note:** A terminal output at localhost:3000 should be displayed once the server is up and running.

👏 All done!
